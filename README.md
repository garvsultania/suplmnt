## ‚ú® Visual Overhaul & Design System (2024)

**suplmnt** now features a premium, modern, and minimalist design system, optimized for mobile and accessibility:

- **Glassmorphism**: All cards, containers, and navigation use a consistent glass effect for a premium feel.
- **Harmonious Color Palette**: Only three accent colors (mint, coral, sunny) are used for a cohesive, high-end look.
- **Soft Gradients**: Subtle gradients are used for backgrounds, cards, and buttons.
- **Typography**: Uses Inter and Poppins for a clean, readable hierarchy. Font sizes and spacing are mobile-first.
- **Consistent Spacing**: Utility classes for section, container, and card spacing ensure a minimalist, airy layout.
- **Icon System**: All icons use utility classes for size and color (`icon-premium`, `icon-accent`, `icon-muted`, etc.).
- **Buttons & Inputs**: All interactive elements use glassmorphism and premium gradients, with large touch targets.
- **Loading States & Animations**: Premium shimmer, pulse, and fade-in effects for a smooth user experience.
- **Mobile-First**: Every component is optimized for mobile screens and touch.
- **Accessibility**: Improved color contrast, focus states, and ARIA labels throughout.

### üõ†Ô∏è Design System Usage

- **Cards/Containers**: Use `card-glass` or `glass` for all main UI blocks.
- **Buttons**: Use `btn-glass`, `btn-primary`, `btn-secondary`, or `btn-accent` for consistent button styles.
- **Icons**: Use `icon-premium`, `icon-accent`, `icon-muted`, `icon-white`, `icon-lg`, `icon-md`, `icon-sm`, and `icon-bg` for all icons.
- **Gradients**: Use `bg-gradient-mint`, `bg-gradient-coral`, `bg-gradient-sunny`, `bg-gradient-main`, `bg-gradient-glass`, or `bg-gradient-overlay` for backgrounds.
- **Spacing/Layout**: Use `section`, `container-premium`, `card-stack`, `row-premium`, `col-premium`, and `spacer-*` utilities for consistent spacing.
- **Inputs**: Use `input-glass` for all form fields.
